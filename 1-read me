summary 


Emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to change the emo-
tional state of an utterance while preserving the linguistic
content and speaker identity. In this paper, we propose a novel
2-stage training strategy for sequence-to-sequence emotional
voice conversion with a limited amount of emotional speech
data. We note that the proposed EVC framework leverages text-
to-speech (TTS) as they share a common goal that is to generate
high-quality expressive voice. In stage 1, we perform style
initialization with a multi-speaker TTS corpus, to disentangle
speaking style and linguistic content. In stage 2, we perform
emotion training with a limited amount of emotional speech
data, to learn how to disentangle emotional style and linguistic
information from the speech. The proposed framework can
perform both spectrum and prosody conversion and achieves
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines in
both objective and subjective evaluation.
